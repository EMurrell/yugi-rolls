                    My parent&apos;s owned a Chinese take-out restaurant for
                    many years and before that a Chinese buffet restaurant. They
                    have since retired and only recently have I convinced them
                    to help me develop the eggless and meatless eggroll. I
                    wanted something to taste just like the eggroll they used to
                    make but without egg and meat. After many prototypes, this
                    eggroll was born, and we named it Yugiroll to differentiate
                    it from the eggroll. As we were selling them at first from
                    our home, YUGI rolls stood for “Your Underground Impossible”
                    Rolls. Also, my fake WWF-type wrestling name in high school
                    was also “Yugi Eggroll”. Thinking back, I am not sure why I
                    decided on such an internalized racial name?

                    Since the Yugiroll, my parents remade some of their other
                    restaurant favourites plant-based as well. As a result, this
                    business now exists and we will continually try to recreate
                    the food I used to love before I went vegan and to better
                    some of the vegan offerings I see now available in Ottawa.
